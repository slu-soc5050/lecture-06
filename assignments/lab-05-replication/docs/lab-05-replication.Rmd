## Introduction
This notebook replicates the `R` portion of Lab-05.

## Dependencies
This notebook requires no external packages or data.

## Part 1: Sampling Distributions
### Question 7
The following code calculates the standard error of this distribution for a situation where $n=500$:

```{r}
10/sqrt(500)
```

The standard error of the repeated samples is $0.447$.

### Question 8
The following code calculates the standard error of this distribution for a situation where $n=1000$:

```{r}
10/sqrt(1000)
```

The standard error of the repeated samples is $0.316$.

### Question 9
The following code calculates the probability of a random sample having a mean greater than or equal to $95$.

```{r}
zScore <- (95-90)/(10/sqrt(500))
print(zScore)
```

```{r}
pnorm(11.18033, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
```


A very, very small proportion of these sames will have sample means less-than or equal to $95$.

### Question 10
The following code calculates the probability of a random sample having a mean greater than or equal to $80$.

```{r}
zScore <- (80-90)/(10/sqrt(500))
pnorm(zScore, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

A very, very small proportion of these sames will have sample means less-than or equal to $80$.

### Question 11
The following code calculates the power analysis for the sample size required to have a sample mean that is within $1$ percentage point of the population's:

```{r}
((1.96*10)/1)^2
```

We would need at least 385 participants to have a sample mean that is within $1$ percentage point of the population's.

### Question 12
The following code calculates the power analysis for the sample size required to have a sample mean that is within $3$ percentage point3 of the population's:

```{r}
((1.96*10)/3)^2
```

We would need at least 43 participants to have a sample mean that is within $3$ percentage points of the population's.

### Question 13
The following code calculates the power analysis for the sample size required to have a sample mean that is within $5$ percentage point3 of the population's:

```{r}
((1.96*10)/5)^2
```

We would need at least 16 participants to have a sample mean that is within $5$ percentage points of the population's.

## Part 2: Predictive Intervals
### Question 14
The following code calculates a lower bound and then an upper bound for the $95\%$ predictive interval for $x$:

```{r}
90-(1.96*10)
90+(1.96*10)
```

We are $95\%$ certain that a given value of $x$ should have a value between $70.4$ and $109.6$.

### Question 15
The following code calculates a lower bound and then an upper bound for the $99.9\%$ predictive interval for $x$:

```{r}
90-(3.29*10)
90+(3.29*10)
```

We are $99.9\%$ certain that a given value of $x$ should have a value between $57.1$ and $122.9$.

### Question 16
The following code calculates a lower bound and then an upper bound for the $95\%$ predictive interval for $\bar{x}$:

```{r}
90-(1.96*(10/sqrt(500)))
90+(1.96*(10/sqrt(500)))
```

Based on the predictive interval, a sample mean should fall between $89.123$ and $90.877$ $95\%$ of the time.

### Question 17
The following code calculates a lower bound and then an upper bound for the $99\%$ predictive interval for $\bar{x}$:

```{r}
90-(2.58*(10/sqrt(500)))
90+(2.58*(10/sqrt(500)))
```

Based on the predictive interval, a sample mean should fall between $88.846$ and $91.154$ $99\%$ of the time.

## Part 3: Confidence Intervals
### Question 18
The following code calculates the key value for a $95\%$ confidence interval:

```{r}
1.96*(10/sqrt(500))
```

If we take a sample size of $n=500$ from our population, the interval of plus or minus $0.877$ has a $95\%$ chance of covering $\mu$.

### Question 19
The following code calculates the key value for a $99\%$ confidence interval:

```{r}
2.58*(10/sqrt(500))
```

If we take a sample size of $n=500$ from our population, the interval of plus or minus $1.154$ has a $99\%$ chance of covering $\mu$.

### Question 20
The following code calculates the key value for a $95\%$ confidence interval:

```{r}
1.96*(10/sqrt(1000))
```

If we take a sample size of $n=1000$ from our population, the interval of plus or minus $0.620$ has a $95\%$ chance of covering $\mu$.

### Question 21
The following code calculates the key value for a $99\%$ confidence interval:

```{r}
2.58*(10/sqrt(1000))
```

If we take a sample size of $n=1000$ from our population, the interval of plus or minus $0.816$ has a $99\%$ chance of covering $\mu$.
